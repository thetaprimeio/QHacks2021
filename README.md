# Parallel Fourier Computing

### About 
This project is a JavaScript implementation of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) using the Distrubted Computing Lab's (DCL) framework for parallel processing. This project is the winner of the QHacks 2021 third place prize as well as the first place DCL prize. Read more on devpost: https://devpost.com/software/parallel-fourier-computing. 

### Try it yourself
